    <h2>Eco Inovation</h2>
    <h4>eco-INNOVATION is a CLEANUP initiative that was designed to increase the demand for plastic waste. This initiative supports small and medium-scale local recycling operations in rural regions and is open to anybody who can come up with unique product ideas to produce from our collected plastics.
These product concepts should be of high quality and, ideally, have little or no market competition from new plastic items. Here are some of our CLEANUP product ideas:
Planters for houseplants,
Bricks for construction,
Rugs and mats,
Bags and sacks.
